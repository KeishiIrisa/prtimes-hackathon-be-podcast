# PRTIMES HACKATHON

## About PRTIMES

[PRTIMES](https://prtimes.jp/) operates the "PR TIMES" service, which widely distributes announcement materials and press releases (news releases) created by companies, government offices, local governments, etc., to the media.

## Objective

Promote the use of press releases by small and medium-sized local enterprises.

## Motivation

We identified two main reasons for the low usage of press releases by small and medium-sized local enterprises:

1. **Limited Marketing Resources**: In local areas, marketing efforts, including press releases, do not yield the same results as in urban areas due to a smaller population, leading to fewer marketing resources.
2. **Lack of Media Attention**: Press releases from local enterprises often go unnoticed by media concentrated in urban areas due to their lower volume and perceived lack of appeal.

To address these issues, we aim to enable local enterprises to post press releases with minimal human effort and create a process that makes their press releases more noticeable and attractive.

## Solution

We propose two solutions:

1. **Automated Press Release Generation**: Based on their past social network posts (e.g., X), we can generate press releases automatically. Social networks are effective free marketing tools, and even if enterprises haven't tried press releases, they are likely to have posted on social networks.
2. **Automated Podcast Generation**: Using the auto-generated press releases from the first solution, we can create podcasts. Podcasts are a significant marketing strategy, with many end users, including consumers and media personnel, listening to them. This new approach—from podcast to press release—will help more people notice their press releases.
